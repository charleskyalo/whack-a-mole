- Where can I see your demo?
    [whaack-mole](https://whaack-mole.netlify.app/)

- What was your experience? 
 <b>tough and full of fun and learning </b> 


 ### First created the project with  webpack ("am  learning how to bundle the code together using it")

 ### I realized was kinda batling with the tool(webpack ) it taking time away from the actual project.

 ### The build which I was hosting with netlify could not run.
 state management issues with the game scoring started arising
 
### what next ?
tldr: created an mvp instead

 I created a branch without webpack ( I removed node_modules package json  files and grabbed the minified phaser js lib instead)
 Am planning to finish the game concept first and worry about  webpack later.

 ## todos
